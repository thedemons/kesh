# kesh
A simple Android memory library in C++

### How does kesh work?
- **kesh** load a process **kesh server** on the android device that communicate with windows using **tcp socket**.
- It uses the **kesh server** to manipulate ```memory, process, module, thread,..``` directly on the android device.
- The **kesh server** is a modified version of the [ceserver](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/tree/master/Cheat%20Engine/ceserver "ceserver") from **Cheat Engine**

### Use Cheat Engine with kesh
- **Cheat Engine** can connect with kesh to work on android devices
- This can be done with this [tutorial]()
- **Cheat Engine** can then scan and attach breakpoints directly in the android device
